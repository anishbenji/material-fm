# material-fm
A file manager built using AngularJS and Angular Material.

It is inspired by [angular-filemanager](https://github.com/joni2back/angular-filemanager) to allow for basic file upload, download and management on the server. My version uses Angular Material instead of Bootstrap.

This is the first open source piece of code I've published. There is still a lot of work to be done before it is ready for prime time. One of the aims of open sourcing it is to learn from the feedback the open source community provides.
Some of the things I hope to will happen are:

- Learn how to do unit and e2e testing including what I should write tests for and how best to structure my tests.
- Learn how to manage an open source project.
- Learn some server-side technologies

## To try it out
Coming soon...
